## "Upstream" Starter Kit






## Refresh Repository From Original Forked Repository

### Step 1: Verify Upstream Attached

In GitHub Desktop - pick the repository that you want to "refresh" from the original repository.  Once it has been selected, choose the "Repository" menu option in the menu bar across the top of the window.  Pick the "Repository settings ..." option under the "Repository" menu.







"Refreshing" a [GitHub](https://github.com/) template usually refers to updating an existing project with the latest changes from the original template repository. This is not an automatic process built into GitHub itself, but can be done using manual Git commands or dedicated third-party actions/tools
