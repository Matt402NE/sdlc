# (Draft) Continuous Integration (CI)

CI (Continuous Integration) is a software development practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository.  Each upload of code changes should trigger an automated build which tests the code to catch errors as early as possible.  This helps ensure the codebase stays stable, and improving code quality as well as the delivery speed.

A general rule of thumb is that each developer should publish changes to the `main` branch at least once per day. Those experienced with CI will integrate more frequently than that.  The impact from bugs is reduced the more rapidly we fix them.
