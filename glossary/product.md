# Product

## Definition
**Product** is the function responsible for **shaping what gets built and why**, translating business goals into clear, actionable, and prioritized work for Engineering. It defines the solution, frames the problem, and ensures that what enters the backlog is valuable, feasible, and aligned with strategy.

**How It Thinks / Behaves (Optional)**
- “What is the user trying to accomplish?”  
- “What is the smallest valuable slice we can deliver?”  
- “What is the strategic impact of this request?”  
- “What tradeoffs make sense?”  

[Product](product.md) defines the solution—balancing user value, business goals, and technical feasibility to determine what should be built next. [Business](business.md) defines the opportunity.  [Engineering](engineering.md) defines how the solution will be built and ensures it can be delivered reliably and sustainably.

## Purpose
Product exists to ensure the organization builds the **right things**, in the **right order**, for the **right reasons**.

In the planning stage of the SDLC, Product:

- Validates clarity and completeness of the **Intake Brief**  
- Ensures **success metrics** and measurable outcomes exist  
- Confirms alignment with strategy, roadmap, and user needs  
- Shapes scope boundaries and identifies assumptions or open questions  
- Requests Engineering sizing only when the request is ready  
- Owns and communicates the **risk score**, especially around ambiguity or missing decisions  
- Determines whether a request is ready to enter the **Product Backlog**  

Product acts as the connective tissue between Business (opportunity) and Engineering (implementation), ensuring planning decisions are grounded in value, clarity, and feasibility.
