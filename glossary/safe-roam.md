# SAFe Risk ROAMing (Resolved, Owned, Accepted, Mitigated)

## Definition
SAFe Risk ROAMing is a lightweight technique used in the Scaled Agile Framework to quickly categorize and disposition risks as Resolved, Owned, Accepted, or Mitigated. It provides a shared, visual way for agile teams and stakeholders to see which risks are being actively handled and how.

**How It Thinks / Behaves**
- Assumes risks should not linger in a generic “open” state; every risk needs a clear disposition.  
- Encourages collaborative discussion and fast triage rather than solitary risk tracking.  
- Focuses on transparency: stakeholders can see which risks are under control and which still need attention.  
- Treats risk management as continuous across planning events, not a one-time exercise.

## Purpose
SAFe Risk ROAMing exists to make risk decisions explicit in large-scale agile planning events (such as PI Planning), so teams and leaders agree on how each significant risk will be handled. It aims to replace vague concern with concrete outcomes and commitments, clarifying who is doing what about which risks and what is simply being accepted.

In an SDLC or planning context, ROAMing helps product and engineering align on delivery risks around scope, dependencies, capacity, technical uncertainty, and external constraints. It can be used at key planning forums and gates to decide if the current set of risks is acceptable for the planned objectives and whether additional mitigation or ownership is required.

## Responsibilities / Components
- **Resolved:** Risks that have been addressed and are no longer considered a threat; document what changed to resolve them.  
- **Owned:** Risks that remain but have a clearly assigned owner responsible for follow-up and next steps.  
- **Accepted:** Risks that are consciously acknowledged and tolerated without further action, often due to low impact or cost–benefit tradeoffs.  
- **Mitigated:** Risks with specific mitigation actions planned or in progress to reduce probability or impact.  
- **Review and communication:** Regularly review the ROAM board or list during planning and synchronization ceremonies so dispositions and ownership stay current.
