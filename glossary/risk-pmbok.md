# PMI’s Qualitative Risk Analysis (PMBOK)

## Definition
PMI’s Qualitative Risk Analysis is a systematic technique from the PMBOK Guide for evaluating identified project risks using descriptive scales (such as high/medium/low) for probability, impact, and sometimes other dimensions like urgency or detectability. It transforms a raw risk list into a prioritized view that highlights which risks warrant more attention, detailed analysis, or immediate action.

**How It Thinks / Behaves**
- Accepts that not every risk justifies detailed quantification and focuses on fast, consistent ranking.  
- Uses agreed scales and criteria so different stakeholders assess risks in a comparable way.  
- Emphasizes workshops, expert judgment, and dialogue to refine understanding of risk characteristics.  
- Treats prioritization as iterative: reassess as new risks emerge or conditions change.

## Purpose
Qualitative Risk Analysis exists to quickly and consistently prioritize project risks so teams can decide where to invest mitigation effort, which items need escalation, and which can be monitored with minimal overhead. It aims to reduce noise in risk discussions, turning long, unfocused risk registers into clear, ordered views that support timely decisions.

In an SDLC or planning context, it helps product and engineering teams decide which delivery risks (e.g., scope, dependencies, security, reliability, stakeholder alignment) are most threatening to objectives and milestones. It also supports gates and portfolio reviews by providing a structured ranking of risks, surfacing those that may require contingency plans, additional funding, or changes in scope or timeline.

## Responsibilities / Components
- **Define scales and criteria:** Establish qualitative scales (e.g., probability and impact levels) and clear descriptions so ratings are applied consistently.  
- **Assess individual risks:** For each identified risk, assign probability, impact, and any additional factors (e.g., urgency, detectability, proximity).  
- **Prioritize and categorize:** Combine ratings into an overall priority, use tools like probability–impact matrices, and group risks by type or owner.  
- **Plan follow-up actions:** Decide which risks need immediate response planning, which warrant further (often quantitative) analysis, and which will be monitored.  
- **Review and update:** Revisit qualitative ratings as the project evolves, new information appears, or risk responses change the exposure.
