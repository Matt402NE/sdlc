# RAID Logs (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies)

## Definition
A RAID log is a simple, structured register used to track four key categories that affect project and product delivery: Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies. It provides a single, living artifact where teams record, review, and update items that could impact outcomes, timelines, or scope, along with their owners and actions.

**How It Thinks / Behaves**
- Assumes that clarity and visibility beat ad hoc, hallway-based risk management.  
- Treats risks, assumptions, issues, and dependencies as related but distinct, each needing its own column and handling.  
- Emphasizes ownership and follow-through: every item should have an owner, status, and next step.  
- Works best when reviewed regularly in planning and status rituals, not filed away after creation.

## Purpose
A RAID log exists to centralize delivery-critical "unknowns and friction points" so the team can systematically monitor, discuss, and resolve them rather than relying on memory or scattered notes. It helps make tradeoffs explicit, supports proactive problem solving, and reduces the risk of surprises late in a project or release.

In an SDLC or planning context, the RAID log acts as a companion to roadmaps and plans, capturing what might derail them (risks), what must hold true (assumptions), what is already off-track (issues), and what relies on others (dependencies). It is often used as an input to gates and governance reviews, where decision-makers look at open RAID items, their severity, and their mitigation status before approving scope, funding, or launch.

## Responsibilities / Components
- **Risks:** Future uncertain events that could positively or negatively impact objectives; recorded with likelihood, impact, owner, and planned response.  
- **Assumptions:** Conditions believed to be true but not yet verified; tracked so they can be validated or revised before they turn into issues.  
- **Issues:** Current problems already impacting the project or product; include severity, owner, target resolution date, and any workarounds.  
- **Dependencies:** Relationships on other teams, systems, vendors, or decisions that must complete on time; capture owners on both sides and key dates.  
- **Review cadence and ownership:** A named owner maintains the log, and the team reviews it at a regular interval (e.g., weekly), updating statuses and escalating as needed.
