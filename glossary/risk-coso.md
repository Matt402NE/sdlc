# COSO ERM (Enterprise Risk Management)

## Definition
COSO ERM is an enterprise risk management framework that integrates risk thinking into governance, strategy, and performance so organizations can manage uncertainty while pursuing their objectives. It provides a principles-based structure for identifying, assessing, responding to, and reporting risks across the whole organization rather than in isolated silos.

**How It Thinks / Behaves**
- Starts from strategy and objectives, then asks “what might affect achievement?” across the portfolio.  
- Treats risk as both downside (threats) and upside (opportunities) to performance.  
- Embeds risk into governance, culture, and day-to-day decision-making instead of treating it as a separate compliance task.  
- Emphasizes continuous review and information flows rather than one-time assessments.

## Purpose
COSO ERM exists to give organizations a coherent way to align risk-taking with their mission, values, and strategic objectives, so that major threats and opportunities are deliberately managed rather than discovered by surprise. It aims to improve decision quality, resilience, and value creation by making risk considerations explicit at the board, executive, and operational levels.

In a planning or SDLC context, COSO ERM guides how product and engineering decisions reflect risk appetite, how major initiatives are evaluated for risk-adjusted value, and how key project risks roll up into an enterprise view. It also informs gates and portfolio reviews by providing criteria and language for judging whether risks are understood, within appetite, and supported by appropriate responses and monitoring.

- **Performance:** Identifies and assesses risks to objectives, prioritizes them, selects responses, and develops a portfolio view of risk.  
- **Review & Revision:** Monitors changes in context and performance, evaluates the effectiveness of risk management, and adjusts the ERM approach as needed.
