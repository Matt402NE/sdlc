# Engineering

## Definition
**Engineering** is the function responsible for **designing, building, and delivering** the technical solution that Product defines and the Business funds. It ensures the solution is **feasible, scalable, maintainable, secure, and aligned with technical strategy**.

**How It Thinks / Behaves
- “What is the simplest technical approach that meets the need?”  
- “What risks or unknowns could derail this?”  
- “How do we balance short‑term delivery with long‑term health?”  
- “What dependencies or constraints must we account for?”  
- “What is the cost of this decision in complexity or maintenance?”  

[Engineering](engineering.md) defines **how** the solution will be built and ensures it can be delivered reliably and sustainably. [Business](business.md) defines the opportunity; [Product](product.md) defines the solution.

## Purpose
Engineering exists to transform validated product requirements into **working, high‑quality software**. 

In the planning stage of the SDLC, Engineering:

- Evaluates **technical feasibility** of proposed solutions  
- Provides **t‑shirt estimates** and confidence levels  
- Identifies **technical unknowns**, risks, and required discovery spikes  
- Highlights **architectural, integration, and scalability** considerations  
- Contributes to the **risk score**, especially around technical volatility  
- Confirms whether a request is **ready for backlog entry** or needs refinement  

Engineering ensures that planning decisions are grounded in reality—balancing feasibility, complexity, and long‑term sustainability.
