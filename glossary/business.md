# Business

## Definition
**Business** is the function that owns the **outcomes**, funding, and strategic goals that drive requests. It represents the organizational need, defines the opportunity, and determines why an initiative matters—without prescribing the solution.

**How It Thinks / Behaves
- “What value will this create for the organization?”  
- “How does this support our strategy or roadmap?”  
- “What budget, constraints, or deadlines shape this request?”  
- “What is the risk of not doing this?” 

[Business](business.md) defines the opportunity, the value, and the investment—setting the strategic context for Product and Engineering. [Product](product.md) defines the solution. [Engineering](engineering.md) defines how the solution will be built and ensures it can be delivered reliably and sustainably.

## Purpose
Business exists to articulate **why** a request matters and what outcomes it must achieve.  
In the planning stage of the SDLC, Business:

- Initiates requests through the **Intake Brief**  
- Provides success criteria, constraints, and budget guardrails  
- Clarifies urgency, dependencies, and strategic alignment  
- Accepts or rejects the **risk score** associated with missing decisions or uncertainty  
- Approves whether a request should move forward into the **Product Backlog**  

Business is the anchor for value, funding, and strategic intent—ensuring that planning decisions are grounded in organizational priorities.
